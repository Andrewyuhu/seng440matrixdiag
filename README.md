<h1>SENG 440 - Matrix Diagonalization </h1>

This repository contains code for a SENG 440 project that covers some basic optimization techniques.

<h2> Versions of Matrix Diagonalization </h2>

**V1** - Basic implementation of a working matrix diagonalization program
**V2** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)
**V3** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)
**V4** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)
**V5** - Refactored the majority of the code for better clarity and efficiency
**V6** - Applied basic optimizations such as loop unrolling
**V7** - Optimized with fixed point arithmetic
