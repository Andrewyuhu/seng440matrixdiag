## SENG 440 - Matrix Diagonalization

This repository contains code for a SENG 440 project that covers some basic optimization techniques.

## Versions of Matrix Diagonalization

**original** - Basic implementation of a working matrix diagonalization program\
**V2** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)\
**V3** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)\
**V4** - Depreceated (Failed attempts of fixed point)\
**V5** - Refactored the majority of the code for better clarity and efficiency\
**V6** - Applied basic optimizations such as loop unrolling\
**V7** - Optimized with fixed point arithmetic
**optimized** - Optimized code
